Interactive graph creation and graph theory visualisation

The user interface and graph creation was done using pygame and networkx. The animation of the graphs was done using matplotlib.

Includes: DFS, BFS, Kruskal's and Dijkstras

This project was meant to be a culmination of all the skills learned so far. These include various graph theory algorithms, the OOP paradigm, the use of various python libraries and designing a user friendly interface to allow for a comphrensive experience.

DEMOSTRATION
------------

I will now give a demonstration of what a user would see if they were to run this program.
First, they would be presented with this GUI which allows them to create their custom graphs.

After clicking "Run", a gif will be generated, showing the algorithm being run on your custom graph. An example is shown below.
