Interactive graph creation and graph theory visualisation

The user interface and graph creation was done using pygame and networkx. The animation of the graphs was done using matplotlib.

Includes: DFS, BFS, Kruskal's and Dijkstras

This project was meant to be a culmination of all the skills learned so far. These include various graph theory algorithms, the OOP paradigm, the use of various python libraries and designing a user friendly interface to allow for a comphrensive experience.
